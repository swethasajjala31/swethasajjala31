### 👋 Hi, I’m @swethasajjala31

- 🎓 I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Software Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
- 💻 I’m passionate about full stack development, AWS DevOps, and data analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **Cloud Computing**.
- 👀 I’m interested in **collaborative projects**, **open-source contributions**, and **innovative tech challenges**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make an impact, especially in areas like **IoT**, **AI/ML**, and **sustainable technology**.
- 📫 You can reach me via [LinkenIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swethasajjala)
- 😄 Pronouns: **She/Her**
- 🍳 When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, binge-watching the latest shows, or dancing like nobody’s watching.
- 💪 Strengths: **Debugging skills sharper than a chef’s knife**, **problem-solving that rivals Sherlock Holmes**, and **an enthusiasm for learning that’s as bottomless as my coffee cup**.
- 😅 Weaknesses: **Can get overly excited about new tech (cue the endless late-night coding sessions)**, **still working on balancing a love for sweets with a fitness routine**, and **the occasional struggle to say "no" to a new project**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once fixed a critical bug while cooking dinner - multitasking at its finest!
